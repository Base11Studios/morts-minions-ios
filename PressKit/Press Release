The game offers something for everyone - multiple worlds, levels and characters, a simple concept and intuitive user experience, an evolving skill system, lots of rewards and an engaging storyline. The result is Mort's Minions, a game I have loved creating and love playing and I know you will too." - Dan Bellinski, creator of Mort's Minions.
