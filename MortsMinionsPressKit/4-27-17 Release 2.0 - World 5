Mort's Minion 2.0 (iOS) a Side-Scrolling Adventure RPG

7/27/2017. Introducing Mort's Minions 2.0 Release, a jam-packed content update with 16 new levels, more storyline, 15 unique minions, and brand new music! Mort's Minions is a side-scrolling adventure RPG built for iOS (iPhone and iPad) released by Base11 Studios, Ltd. 

The game is a simple and artistic auto runner with a retro feel. The player jumps, blocks, and fights back to defend against the attack of minions using several of over 25 unique skills. Players tap the screen to jump, or 1 of 4 skill buttons layered into the game over time.

The storyline portrays the oppression of the minions and ends with a lesson about respecting and loving all creatures on the planet. One could make parallels with todayâ€™s society and make the world a better place by taking these morals to heart!

Indie Developer title. The entire game was created by me, including design, art, animations, code, sound effects, and music. Music is being replaced this release with tracks from a musical composer to enhance the experience!

Mort's Minions 2.0 will be available in the iOS App Store on 4/27/17.
